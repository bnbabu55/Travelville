            <p><strong>Use of cookies by Travelville</strong></p>
            <p>
              You are advised that the company Travelville uses cookies or other
              tracers on its online booking sites Travelville.com
            </p>
            <p>
              These tracers may be installed on your device depending on the
              preferences that you expressed or may express at any time in
              accordance with this policy.
            </p>
            <p><strong>1. Why have a cookies policy?</strong></p>
            <p>
              With a view to provide information and ensure transparency,
              Travelville established this policy so that you can learn more about:
            </p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                The origin and purpose of the information processed when you browse
                Travelville websites
              </li>
              <li>

            </ol>
            <p><strong>2. What is a cookie?</strong></p>
            <p>
              Cookies and other similar tracers are packets of data used by servers
              to send status information to a user's browser and return status
              information to the original server through this same browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              The status information can be a session identifier, a language, an
              expiration date, a response field or other types of information.
            </p>
            <p>
              During their validity period, cookies are used to store status
              information when a browser accesses various pages of a website or when
              the browser returns to this website at a later point.
            </p>
            <p>There are different types of cookies:</p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Session cookies, which are deleted as soon as you exit the browser
                or leave the website
              </li>
              <li>
                Persistent cookies, which remain on your device until their
                expiration or until you delete them using the features of your
                browser
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>3. Why use cookies?</strong></p>
            <p>
              We use cookies and other tracers primarily for the following purposes:
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies strictly necessary for browsing the Travelville Websites and

              <li>
                Store specific information that you enter on Travelville websites in
                order to facilitate and customize your subsequent visits (including
                displaying the visitor's first and last names if the visitor has a

              Cookies for visitor tracking are aimed at improving the comfort of
              users by helping us understand your interactions with Travelville
              Websites (most visited pages, applications used, etc.); these cookies
              may collect statistics or test different ways of displaying
              information in order to improve the relevance and usability of our
              services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Advertising cookies are intended to (i) offer you, in advertising
              spaces, relevant, targeted content that may be of interest to you
              (best offers, other destinations, etc.) based on your interests,
              browsing behaviour, preferences, and other factors, and (ii) reduce
              the number of times that the advertisements appear.
            </p>
            <p>
              Affiliate cookies identify the third-party website that redirected a
              visitor to Travelville websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Social network cookies, set by third parties, allow you to share your
              opinion about and content from Travelville websites on social networks
              (for example, the "Share" or "Like" application buttons for social
              networks).
            </p>
            <p>
              The social network applications on Travelville websites as mentioned
              above can in some cases allow the social networks concerned to
              identify you even if you did not click on the application button.
            </p>
            <p>
              This type of button can allow a social network to track your browsing
              on Travelville websites, simply because your account in the social
              network concerned is enabled on your device (open session) while you
              are browsing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We recommend that you read the policies of these social networks to
              familiarize yourself with how they use the browsing information they
              may collect, especially with regard to advertising. These policies
              must specifically allow you to make choices on these social networks,
              particularly by configuring your user accounts for each of them.
            </p>
            <p><strong>4. Consent</strong></p>
            <p>
              The installation of certain cookies is subject to your consent. Also,
              when you first visit the Travelville websites, you are asked whether
              you agree to the installation of this type of cookie, which is only
              activated after your acceptance.
            </p>
            <p>
              This process is supported by means of an information banner on the
              home page of the Travelville websites, which informs you that by
              continuing to browse, you are agreeing to the installation of cookies
              that require consent on your device.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can change your mind at any time using the various methods
              described in section "Deleting and/or blocking cookies".
            </p>
            <p><strong>5. Deleting and/or blocking cookies</strong></p>
            <p>You have several options for deleting cookies and other tracers.</p>
            <p>
              <strong><br />Browser settings</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Although most browsers are set by default to accept cookies, you can,
              if you desire, choose to accept all cookies, always block cookies, or
              choose which cookies to accept based on their senders.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also set your browser to accept or block cookies on a
              case-by-case basis before they are installed. Your browser also allows
              you to regularly delete cookies from your device. Remember to
              configure all the browsers in your different devices (tablets,
              smartphones, computers, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
              Regarding management of cookies and your preferences, configuration
              varies for each browser. This is described in the Help menu of your
              browser, as well as how to edit your preferences with regard to
              cookies. For example:

              Saving a cookie to your device depends on your wishes, which you can
              exercise and change at any time and free of charge using the settings
              offered by your browser software.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your browser is set to accept cookies on your device, the cookies
              embedded in the pages and content that you view may be temporarily
              stored in a dedicated space on your device. They can only be read by
              their issuer.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, you can set your browser to block cookies. Keep in mind that
              if you set your browser to block cookies, some features, pages and
              spaces on Travelville Websites will not be accessible, and we cannot
              be held responsible in this case.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Specialized advertising platforms</strong></p>
            <p>
              Several professional advertising platforms also give you the option to
              accept or block cookies used by companies that are members. These
              centralized mechanisms do not block the display of ads; they simply
              prevent the installation of cookies that tailor ads to your interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, you can visit the website
              <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank"
                >http://www.youronlinechoices.com</a
